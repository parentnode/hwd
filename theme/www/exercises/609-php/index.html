			<h1>Exercise 609 - Janitor navigation</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about developing your first Janitor based PHP project
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this exercise is to work with your personal Janitor project to gain experience
				with Janitor.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Understand navigations</h3>
					<p>
						A Janitor project is born with two default navigation lists. One primary navigation for 
						the frontend (main) and another primary navigation for the backend interface (main-janitor).
					</p>
					<p>
						The frontend navigation list is included in your page via the 
						<em>theme/templates/www.footer.php</em> template. There you can also see
						how to get a navigation list and how you might turn it into HTML.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can modify the navigation lists through Janitor. Go to <em>Site</em> -> <em>Navigations</em>
						and select the navigation list you want to manage. You can also create any number of 
						additional navigation lists, that you can use in your templates.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Update the main navigation</h3>
					<p>
						Go to <em>Site</em> -> <em>Navigation</em> in Janitor and choose the <em>main</em> navigation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Add your new controller as a navigation element. Use the <em>Static URL</em> â€“ the other options
						does not apply in this case.
					</p>
					<p>
						Add navigation elements for one of the access restricted endpoints your made earlier
						(test1 or test2) as well. If you log out you will see that only accessible navigation
						items are shown.
					</p>
