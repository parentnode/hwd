			<h1>Exercise 405 - Janitor and Detector</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about developing your first Janitor based PHP project
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this exercise is to work with your personal Janitor project to gain experience
				with Janitor and Detector segments.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Understand the Detector segments</h3>
					<p>
						Janitor natively supports 
						<a href="https://detector.parentnode.dk">Detector segments</a>. While Janitor can also be used entirely without segments
						it is recommended to use the segments to provide optimized UI's for each segment, rather than 
						<em>one size fits all</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Janitor will automatically detect the segment of the visiting browser, by making a request
						to the Detector API, when the <em>$page->segment</em>
						method is called. As default this happens in the <em>templates/www.header.php</em> template, where
						the segment of the current user's browser is used to include the correct JavaScript and CSS. The detection 
						process only happens once per site visit and the detected segment is stored in the user session for
						the duration of the visit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Janitor accepts a <em>segment=#segment-value#</em> GET parameter on any page, which will force the browser to run
						under the specified segment. Fx. <em>/?segment=smartphone</em> will force the site to show the smartphone UI.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition Janitor accepts a <em>dev=1</em> GET parameter on any page, which will force the site 
						to load the development code, rather than the generated production code. This parameter simply
						indicates whether to include the system generated JavaScript and CSS bundles or the individual
						source files. Use <em>dev=1</em> when developing for better debugging. The opposite of <em>dev=1</em>
						is <em>dev=0</em>. You can observe the difference using the Network pane of your browsers developer 
						tools.
					</p>
					<p>
						You will learn more about how to structure your JavaScript and CSS and how to create
						production bundles in the following exercises.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Defining the segment support</h3>
					<p>
						The exact segment support can be individualized for each Janitor project. You can choose to use
						all the original 12 segments individually for an extensive browser support – but you can also 
						group relevant segments to fit the exact browser support needs of your project and minimize the
						development effort.
					</p>
					<p>
						We differentiate between the 12 original segments from Detector (available segments) and the 
						segments or group segments you choose to support in your project (supported segments). Although 
						Detector will always return the original Detector segment for any given browser, you can customize
						which segment values $page->segment can return in your project.
					</p>
					<p>
						In <em>theme/config/segments.php</em> you will find the settings for your current project
						in an associative Array. You will find that the keys represent the available segments,
						and the values specify the supported segments. In other words, it defines which segment will be
						applied if a desktop_light browser visits your page - in this case <em>unsupported</em>. Likewise,
						<em>smartphone</em> stays <em>smartphone</em> and <em>tablet</em> joins the <em>desktop</em> segment.
