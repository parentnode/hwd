			<h1>Exercise 205 - HTML form</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about styling form HTML.
			</p>

			<p>
				The purpose of this exercise is to practice writing CSS, by applying a specific interactive "design" to an 
				HTML form. The goal is to make the form html look like the reference graphic, which will be visible when 
				you hover the mouse over the text in the top of the page â€“ <strong>without</strong> changing the HTML.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since this is an interactive design, the reference graphic shows the form with the "Last name"-field focused. 
				There is a video in the bottom of this page to show the entire form interaction.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Add CSS</h3>
					<p>
						Add your own CSS to the style-tag in the top of the exercise template (205/index.html), 
						to make the form appear <em>exactly</em> as in the reference graphic.
					</p>
					<p class="note">
						Applied screenshot is taken in Firefox on Mac. The checkbox is a standard system checkbox,
						which will look different on different systems.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Validate your CSS on w3c</h3>
					<p>
						Use <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator" target="_blank">https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator</a> to validate your CSS.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
