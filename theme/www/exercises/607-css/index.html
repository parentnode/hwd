			<h1>Exercise 607 - Janitor and CSS</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about developing your first Janitor based PHP project
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this exercise is to work with your personal Janitor project to gain experience
				with Janitor and CSS.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Understand the CSS folder</h3>
					<p>
						Your CSS lives in <em>theme/www/css</em>. As default Janitor expects you to use
						Detector segments and this is reflected in the default file structure.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inside the <em>theme/www/css</em> folder you will find two folders, <em>lib</em> and <em>fonts</em>
						and some files like <em>seg_desktop.css</em> and <em>seg_smartphone.css</em>. The CSS files in this
						folder are merged segment-files, that has been generated by the system and should <strong>never</strong> be edited.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <em>lib</em> folder is where you write your CSS. In the <em>lib</em> folder you find
						a <em>desktop</em> and a <em>smartphone</em> folder. They are intended for desktop and smartphone CSS
						respectively. This is where you will place your CSS, preferably structured in multiple files.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is normal to start your project with an s-page.css, an s-header.css, an s-content.css and an s-footer.css
						containing the generalized CSS of your site. Deviations should be placed in either an s-pages.css (if there are
						only few deviations), or in individual files named by the module/page they cover.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the <em>lib</em> folder, you will find an s-fonts.css file. This contains the font specifications and
						this file is almost always shared between the different segments.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the <em>lib</em> folder, you will also find some files like <em>seg_desktop_include.css</em> and 
						<em>seg_smartphone_include.css</em>. These files contain the include settings for their segment â€“ in this
						the <em>desktop</em> or <em>smartphone</em> segments respectively. The segment support can be expanded to cover all 12 Detector
						segments, but in most cases less will do, by grouping segments to fit your needs, as explained in exercise
						405.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Modify the desktop <em>page</em> CSS</h3>
					<p>
						In <em>theme/www/css/lib/desktop</em> you will find an <em>s-page.css</em> file, containing the <em>base</em>
						desktop CSS of your site. Make some changes to the CSS and see what happens. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Modify the smartphone <em>page</em> CSS</h3>
					<p>
						In <em>theme/www/css/lib/smartphone</em> you will find an <em>s-page.css</em> file, containing the <em>base</em>
						smartphone CSS of your site. Make some changes to the CSS and see what happens. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Customize your site</h3>
					<p>
						Add some CSS to your new templates or rewrite the entire CSS for the site. Or something in-between.
						Mix-in some JavaScript if you feel like it.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Remember</h3>
					<p>
						Never use inline CSS in your templates. Ever. No.
					</p>
					<p>
						No.
					</p>
				</li>
