			<h1>Exercise 100 - Introduction to HTML</h1>
			<p>
				This introduction page might seem a bit controversial.
				Since it's not an introduction to html from the very basics. 
				The reason is that you will be given the tools to find the right information as a part of an exercise.  
				Because finding the right information is in it self a challenge. 
				We will get more into that. 
				The aim of this course is also to give you the tools so you can find information your own. 
				Because that is what real programmers do.
				Since you are on a course and we have limited time together it is in everyone's interest 
				that we spend the time in the best possible way.  
				One not so preferred way to spend the time is explaining simple things that you could easily look up yourself. 
				An other more preferred way is to let you give it an honest try and see how far you can get by yourself. 
				When you are stuck or done you will get feedback, and if there are concepts that doesn't make sense to you can get them explained.
				So the time you spend on reading and learning yourself is time you get learning the tricks of the trade that aren't in the books :) 
				But remember if you are really stuck in general on this curse, ask for help, or work on something else until you can get help :) 
			</p>

			<p>
				The rest of the information on this page is regarding documentation 
				how you actually write good html, do's and don'ts
				and how we do things here in town.  
			</p>

			<h3>How to find the right information about a programing language?</h3>
			<p>
			The information about how a programming language is working is called the documentation.  
			The documentation is a page where the developers of the language,
			 hopefully write most of the things that are needed for people to use the language. 
			If they are good and nice programmers they even explain how to set everything up and how to get started.and have lots of examples. 
			But sometimes there is few examples and its like a sheet where you can't figure out what's what. 
			Maybe only the developer behind the language knows. 
			But in our case there is plenty of great documentation on html 
			and the other languages we are gonna use in the next coming exercises.
			So don't worry, but you might as well get use to finding the information in the documentation.
			Every good programmer knows this.
			</p>

			<p>So what can you do to find the documentation for html and learn the basics? think a little..</p>
			
			<p>try googling: html documentation.</p>
			<p>take a look at the different links that google presents</p>
			<p>If you type "documentation html" and choose the first link its most likely good enough</p>
			<p>Now you hopefully found a website with the documentation for html</p>
			<p>if you found https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML you found a very good starting point</p>
			<p>The team behind the web browser firefox has done a great job on writing excellent documentation for html, css and javascript.</p>
			<p>That is the right one to use.</p>

			<p>So now go in on the page and look for a tutorial, getting started or anything like that or search on google</p>
			<p>If you search on google remember to write "mdn" in the search as well. The 3 letters mdn is short for mozilla developer network.</p>
			<p>That way you make sure you don't find all sort of random stuff when you are looking for code examples in the future</p>

			<p>
				To see how you use html in some very well made videos visit kahn academy html and css <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">course</a>. 
				Here you will get up to speed very fast if you are new to coding. 
				Also if you are a programmer its worth a visit their css and javascript tutorial is amazing and its made for children in mind, And its all free.

			<h3>The importance of html structure</h3>

			<p>Now you hopefully got a grasp of the most commen tags: "h1", "h2", "h3", "p", "a", "img", "em", "strong","br" "span", and "div"  </p>

			<p>
				Right away you wont need the "br" the break tag, so forget about that. 
				We will use styling with css to make it look the way we want later. that is the 
				rule.
			</p>

			<p>Did you know that if you design your html smartly you can make it look anyway you want? later with Css</p>
			<p>Take a look at this page, <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">zengarden.com</a></p>
			<p>
				Stop reading for a while and go in and check out what possible to do just with styling, just as an appetizer.
				See the different pages, the most impressive might be the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/219/">steel</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				In general you right click on any website and select source code, you can see the html underneath.
				So you can basically see how everyone else is doing something, and how bad and totally confusing html can look as well.
				In the zen garden page it's the same source code for every different design.
				think about that for a moment, this is important and make this you html mantra. 
			</p>

			<p><em>"The html is not the design."</em> - unknown zen master developer.</p>

			<p>
				So lets talk a bit about structure and why its is so important, 
				First of all most html documents typically consist of a "header" a "footer" and something in between, lets call the in between "content".
				Just look at source code of this page (right click -> source).
				Here you can see the div's within div's. 
				right "above" the "content div" is an empty "header div", and "below" the content is an "empty" "footer div".
				they are all on the same "level" in the if you will. or they are siblings. They have the same parent div with the "id = page".
				you can see that there is a body tag that has a sibling called head. 
				These to children body and head has a parent called html. there you have the whole family. 
				Do you notice a system here?
				Everytime there is a child or children there is an indentation.
				and indentation happens is when you press the tab button in a document, sit on the left side of your keyboard left to the letter Q.
				it makes 4 spaces infront of the letter behind it like so: 
			</p>

			<p class="tab">indent example</p>
			
			<p>
				note that the html tag is not indented. That is convention. 
				That is because everyone has agreed to not indent everything to the right one extra time for no real reason. 
				in that way all the divs in the html document has a better chance of staying inside the screen.
				So you could acually write html with making indentation at all it would just become very confusing. 
				while we are at it remember that tags are always above each other. 
				here is how to do it 
				<code>
&lt;div class="outer_div"&gt;
	&lt;div class="Im_a_div" &gt;
		&lt;div class= "long" &gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				&#8;Im a long text that goes farrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
				&#8;note how all my text and my other tags inside are indented
				&#8;and I would like my programmer to se my end tag. 
				&#8;&lt;span&gt;Im a span in a paragraph &lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;div class= "short" &gt;
&#9;&#9;&#9;&#60;p&#62;im a short text only one line&#60;/p&#62;&#10;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
				</code>
			</p>
			<p>	
				Why is the header before the content? 
				The header is for al sort of information that should be seen first. 
				Like if you where a blind person using this it would be nice there was a phone number, or email address. 
				If you are blind you aplication the read to you what is happening at the screen will 
				will most likely start from the top. 
				html is loaded from top to bottom so in the case you have a really slow computer or/and internet access 
				you will also want to load the most important things on top like contact detail.
