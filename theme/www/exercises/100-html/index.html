			<h1>Exercise 100 - Introduction to HTML</h1>
			<p>
				This introduction page might seem a bit controversial.
				Since it's not an introduction to html from the very basics. 
				The reason is, that you will be given the tools to find the right information as a part of an exercise.  
				Because finding the right information is in it self a challenge. 
				We will get more into that. 
				The aim of this course is also to give you the tools so you can find information on your own. 
				Because that is what real programmers do.
				Since you are on a course and we have limited time together it is in everyone's interest 
				that we spend the time in the best possible way.  
				One not so preferred way to spend the time is explaining simple things that you could easily look up yourself. 
				An other more preferred way is that you give it an honest try, and see how far you can get by yourself. 
				When you are stuck or done with an exercise you will get feedback, and if there are concepts that doesn't make sense, you can get them explained.
				So the time you spend on reading and learning yourself is time you get learning the tricks of the trade that aren't in the books :) 
				But remember if you are really stuck in general on this curse, ask for help, or work on something else until you can get help :) 
			</p>

			<p>
				The rest of the information on this page is regarding documentation, why the structure of html is important for search engines. 
				how you actually write good html, general do's and don'ts
				and how we do things here in town and how to get help online.  
			</p>

			<h3>How to find the right information about a programing language?</h3>
			<p>
				The information about how a programming language is working is called the documentation(docs for short).  
				The documentation is a page where the developers of the language,
				hopefully, write most of the things that are needed for people to use the language. 
				If they are good and nice programmers they even explain how to set everything up and how to get started. 
				Good docs have lots of examples.  
				But in our case there is plenty of great documentation on html
				and the other languages we are gonna use in the exercises down the line.
				So don't worry, but you might as well get use to finding the information in the documentation.
				Every good programmer knows this.
			</p>

			<p>So what can you do to find the documentation for html and learn the basics? Think a little..</p>
			
			<p>Try googling: html documentation.</p>
			<p>Take a look at the different links that google presents.</p>
			<p>If you type "documentation html" and choose the first link its most likely good enough.</p>
			<p>Now you hopefully found a website with the documentation for html</p>
			<p>if you found https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML you found a very good starting point</p>
			<p>The team behind the web browser Firefox has done a great job on writing excellent documentation for html, css and javascript.</p>
			<p>That is the one to use, its the best out there.</p>

			<p>So now go in on the page and look for a tutorial, getting started or anything like that or search on google</p>
			<p>If you search on google remember to write "mdn" in the search as well. The 3 letters mdn is short for mozilla developer network.</p>
			<p>That way you make sure you don't find all sort of random stuff when you are looking for code examples in the future</p>

			<p>
				To see how you use html in some very well made videos visit the kahn academy html and css 
				<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">course</a>. 
				Here you will get up to speed very fast if you are new to coding. 
				Also if you not new to programming its worth a visit their css and javascript tutorial is amazing, and its made for children in mind.
				What ever you do, come back here when you know the basics html is fairly simple and shouldn't take to long to understand.

			<h3>The importance of html structure</h3>

			<p>Now you hopefully got a grasp of the most commen tags: "h1", "h2", "h3", "p", "a", "img", "em", "strong","br" "span", and "div"  </p>

			<p>
				Right away you wont need the "br" the break tag, so forget about that. 
				We will use styling with css to make it look the way we want later. 
				So we can make our own distances between "p" tags or any tag we want really with CSS.  
			</p>


			<p>Did you know that if you organize your html smartly you can make it look anyway you want later with CSS?</p>
			<p>Take a look at this page, <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">zengarden.com</a></p>
			<p>
				Stop reading for a while and go in and check out what is possible to do just with styling, just as an appetizer.
				See the different pages, the most impressive might be the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/219/">steel</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Okay if you are back from your visual adventure. 
				Can you believe that all the different themes on csszengarden was made with the exact same html? 
				If you right click on any website and select source code, you can see the html underneath.
				try to do that with the csszengarden page and also this page. 
				Think about that for a moment, this is important and make this you "html mantra". 
			</p>

			<p><em>"The html is not the design."</em> - unknown zen master developer.</p>

			<p>
				So lets talk a bit about structure and why its is so important, 
				First of all most html documents typically consist of a "header" a "footer" and something in between, lets call the in between "content".
				Just look at source code of this page.
				Here you can see the div's within div's, and inside those p tags and inside those em tag and so on. 
				Right "above" the "content div" is an empty "header div", and "below" the content is an "empty" "footer div".
				they all live on the same "level" if you will, or they are siblings. They have the same parent div with the "id = page".
				you can see that there is a body tag that has a sibling called head. 
				These to children, body and head, have a parent called html. There you have the whole family. 
				Do you notice a system here?
				Every time there is a child or children there is an indentation.
				Indentations happen when you press the tab button in a document. The tab sits on the very left side of your keyboard next to the letter Q.
				it makes 4 spaces in front of the letter behind it like so: 
			</p>

			<p class="tab">look at me I'm an indent example</p>
			
			<p>
				Note that the "html" tag is not indented in the source code. That is convention. 
				That is because everyone has agreed to let it sit on the same level as its children to save space. 
				There is no need to move everything thing more to the right than needed. 
				In that way all the div's in the html document has a better chance of staying inside the screen 
				when you use the code.
				So you could actually write html without making indentation at all, 
				it would just become very confusing. 
				While we are at it remember that tags are always above each other. 
				here is how to do it: 
				<code>
&lt;div class="outer_div"&gt;
	&lt;div class="Im_a_div" &gt;
		&lt;div class= "long" &gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
				;Im a long text that goes farrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
				&#8;note how all my text and my other tags inside are indented relative to my p tag.
				&#8;and I would like my programmer to se my end tag. 
				&#8;&lt;span&gt;Im a span in a paragraph &lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;div class= "short" &gt;
			&#8;&lt;p&gt;im a short text only one line, my&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
				</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				Note to span in the paragraph, is inside the p tag.
				Note also that the short line has p tags in the end and the front on the same line.
			</p>
			<p>
				While we are talking about indentation. I wanna give you a trick. 
				you can actually take a whole section indented the same time
			</p>

			<p>	
				Why is the header before the content? 
				The header is for al sort of information that should be seen first. 
				Like if you where a blind person using this it would be nice there was a phone number, or email address. 
				If you are blind you aplication the read to you what is happening at the screen will 
				will most likely start from the top. 
				html is loaded from top to bottom so in the case you have a really slow computer or/and internet access 
				you will also want to load the most important things on top like contact detail.

			<h3>Something about HTML – it is a markup language, read by search engines</h3>
			
			

			<p>The developers behind firefox (mozilla), has made a really nice and basic introduction to html on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">mdn </a></p>
