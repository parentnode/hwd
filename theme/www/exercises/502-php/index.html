			<h1>Exercise 502 - PHP</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about your first PHP loops and conditionals.
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this exercise is to use PHP and get familiar with the basics language syntax.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Create a new PHP file</h3>
					<p>
						In your homework folder, copy the 502 exercise material folder into your homework folder.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Read through the script</h3>
					<p>
						Read the code inside the work file, 502/index.php. It contains 3 Arrays, one of which is indexed, one that
						is associative and one that is multidimensional. Notice the different ways values can be added to the array.
						You will be using for and foreach loops as well as some if statements to complete the exercise.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using print_r($indexed); will output the array content in a structured form, although you may need to 
						look at the source output to see it (view page source).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Output $indexed</h3>
					<p>
						Use a for loop to loop through the content of $indexed and print out each value as 
						a &lt;li&gt; in a valid HTML list (&lt;ul&gt;).
					</p>
					<p>
						Do not output the "Don't print me" element. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Output $associative</h3>
					<p>
						Use a foreach loop to loop through the content of $associative and print out each key and value as 
						an &lt;dd&gt; and &lt;dt&gt; in a valid HTML definition list (&lt;dl&gt;). 
					</p>
					<p>
						Do not output the "Don't print me" element. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Output $multidimensional</h3>
					<p>
						Use nested foreach loop to loop through the content of $multidimensional and print out the content 
						in nested html structure, where the <em>indices</em> (the keys of the arrays) becomes headers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Do not output the "Don't print me" element â€“ or the <em>facts</em> sub array of <em>aliens</em>. 
					</p>
				</li>
