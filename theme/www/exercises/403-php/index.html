			<h1>Exercise 403 - PHP</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about developing your first Janitor based PHP project
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this exercise is to work with your personal Janitor project to gain experience
				with frameworks and PHP.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Add controller endpoints</h3>
					<p>
						Every part (separated by /) of the URL you request is either a controller or a REST parameter for the
						controller. Fx. if your controller is called test.php, then a request to /test/help, will pass
						the parameter <em>help</em> to the test.php controller via the <em>$actions</em> array.
					</p>
					<p>
						Modify the controller you added in exercise 403 and add controller logic so that the controller
						is able to respond to two parameters. If you send <em>test1</em> it should show a different template
						than if you send <em>test2</em>. It should still maintain the default output if no parameters are
						sent. Create additional templates as needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can use the posts.php controller as inspiration. This
						controller is able to act differently depending on which parameters it receives. If it has just one
						parameter, then it will show the <em>pages/post.php</em> template. If it has two parameters and the first
						one is <em>tag</em>, then it will show the <em>pages/posts_tag.php</em> template. Otherwise it will
						just show the <em>pages/posts.php</em> template, which is the default view of this controller.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Visit your new page</h3>
					<p>
						Visit the page you have created and test how it works when you send the new parameters. 
						If your controller is named test.php, then visit <em>/test</em>, <em>/test/test1</em> and 
						<em>/test/test2</em> on your local project domain.
					</p>
				</li>
