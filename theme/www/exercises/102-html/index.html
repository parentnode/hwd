			<h1>Exercise 102 - HTML, Your student profile</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about creating you own student profile for this course. This page will be used throughout the
				course and allows you to apply what you have learned, in a freestyle manner.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two purposes of this exercise: To write HTML <strong>and</strong> to gain more experience with doing so.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>

				<li>
					<h3>Create your profile folder in classroom</h3>
					<p>
						First you create a new folder with your name of choice in the <em>classroom</em> folder. In the <em>classroom</em> folder you will
						see the folders of other participants. If the name you wanted is already taken, then please select another name
						for your profile folder.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Copy the clean HTML file to use as a starting point</h3>
					<p>
						In <em>classroom/new-participant</em> you will find an index.html file – copy it to your classroom 
						profile folder to have a starting point for your profile page.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add some content to your profile page</h3>
					<p>
						With what you have learned in the first exercise, add some html to your profile page. You can add what you want –
