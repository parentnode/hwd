			<h1>Exercise 500 - Introduction to PHP</h1>
			<p>
				PHP is a scripting language, in many ways similar to JavaScript. It is very easy to get started with, it is 
				enormously flexible and well covered in both documentation, available libraries and updates and you are about to
				join a community of more than 6 million PHP developers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because now you will learn it too.
			</p>
			<p>
				PHP scripts have the .php extension. By giving the file the .php extension your webserver knows to execute 
				any php code blocks present in the file, before serving the output to the browser. If you write PHP code inside an
				.html file, it will come out as text.
			</p>
			<p>
				A PHP script is only executed in blocks of code between the start tag, <em>&lt;?php</em>, and the 
				end tag, <em>?&gt;</em>. A shorthand for the start tag, &lt;, can be used in most environments.
			</p>
			<p>
				PHP can be mixed in with HTML to make the content dynamic. You can add a PHP start tag anywhere in 
				your script, and have regular HTML outside the PHP blocks.
			</p>
			<p>
				In PHP scripts, you may omit the end script tag, if PHP is the ending block of the script.
			</p>
			<p>
				Variables are defined using a $-sign, so $string is a variable. Variables does not need to be declared 
				before being used.
			</p>
			<p>
				Something else that will become clear during the next classes.
