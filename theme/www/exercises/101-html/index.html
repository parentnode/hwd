			<h1>Exercise 101 - HTML text</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is dealing with very basic semantic HTML content formatting, using only 
				heading (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt;), paragraph (&lt;p&gt;), a (&lt;a&gt;), strong (&lt;strong&gt;) and emphasize (&lt;em&gt;) tags.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are two purposes of this exercise: To write HTML <strong>and</strong> to practice deducting
				the semantic structure of an unformatted text.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Get the materials ready</h3>
					<p>
						The materials for this exercise if found in the folder <em>exercises/101-html/101</em>. Copy the 101 folder to your 
						personal homework folder in <em>homework</em>. You created your personal homework folder before you started the
						exercises.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add HTML to the text in 101/index.html</h3>
					<p>
						The structure and hierarchy of the text needs to be reflected by html. You will need to read the
						text to identify the hierarchy of the text.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add a tags for the links</h3>
					<p>
						Links in the text are marked in [xxx]. The links should be applied to the paragraph just before 
						the brackets, using the value inside the brackets as the href property.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add strong and emphasis tags</h3>
					<p>
						Certain words in the sentences could use some additional markup because the are particularly 
						important or needs emphasis.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Check your HTML formatting</h3>
					<p>
						Make sure you opened and closed all tags appropriately.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Validate your HTML on w3c</h3>
					<p>
						Use <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a> to validate your HTML.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Check the document outline</h3>
					<p>
						Use <a href="https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/" target="_blank">https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/</a> to a get a structural representation of your HTML.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h2>Resources</h2>

				Check out khanacademy and Mozilla developer network (mdn) it's a great place to find inspiration for how to solve the problems.

			<h2>Do's and don'ts</h2>

				<h3>Do's</h3>

					<h4>Organize your our html, for you, people and the search engines</h4>
					<p>
						It is important that your html is organized in such a way,
						that it improves your search rank on google.
						The "higher up" your page gets on google the better is the chance that people find it. 
						At the same time its important for people to get an overview when they look at our page, 
						and last but no least you also need to keep an overview of our articles headings paragraphs and subheadings. 
						Read more about html structure why its important and how to do it here on
						<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals"> structure</a>
					</p>

					<h4>Example good structure and good indentation:</h4>

					<code>
&lt;h1&gt;Animals living on earth&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;intro text&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&#9;&lt;h2&gt;Habitats&lt;/h2&gt;&#10;&#9;&lt;p&gt;intro text block&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#9;&#9;&lt;h3&gt;Cold climate&lt;/h3&gt;&#10;&#9;&#9;&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&lt;h3&gt;Warm climate&lt;/h3&gt;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&lt;h4&gt;tropical&lt;/h4&gt;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&lt;h4&gt;subtropical&lt;/h4&gt;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&#9;&lt;h2&gt;Types of animals&lt;/h2&gt;&#10;&#9;&#9;and so on..
					</code>
					<p>
						Note that 1 indentation is normally the size of 4 "spaces" 
						or 2 "spaces", but we use the size of 4 "spaces",
						if you press the tab button (the one next to the letter Q) 
						you can make an indentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note also that there is only one heading h1 in the example above. That is a 
						general rule, you only have one h1 per article.  
						So if you have 5 pages and you have one article on each, you should have 5 h1's for example.
					</p>
						Note that the h2 tags are over each other, this is important.
						Note also the the headings comes in a row, from h1,h2,h3,h4, all the way to h5 and h6 .
						You cant have an h3 for example without having an h2 above it. 
					<p>

					</p>

						<h5>tips for good headings</h5>
						<p>
							Headings are a very important for search engines, 
							and people, especially h1. Make sure the headings reveal as much information as possible, 
							the headings are not a teaser, confusing or abstract. 
							The headings should be precise and descriptive and not to short.
							the worst kind of headings are misleading, 
							and not at all what is really going on in the article, like form of direct "click bait".
							or bad news papers headings. 
							Good headings are so good that you get a feeling 
							you already know exactly what the rest of the article is about.
							The search algorithm will reward you for this kind of honest behavior.
							So think twice about what ou write in a heading.  
						</p>

					<h4>Pay attention to "white space"</h4>
					<p>
						White space is newline's between paragraph or headings ect.
						it can actually even be the 
						Make sure that the "white space" makes sense and there is a consistent system behind it.
						Often It can make sense to leave on line of white space above a heading to make it more readable.
						Remember to delete all the white space that dosen't have a purpose.
					</p>

					<h4>Starting to think about arranging html elements for styling </h4> 
					<p>
						This is a more complex task that we will get more into in later exercises. 
						For now you need to know that all elements (divs, headings, paragraph ect) 
						can be moved around pretty much as you please later with css. 
						Every start and end tag and also image tags makes up what is called an element. 
						These are all blocks that takes up space in a form of a square on the screen.
						Some elements like divs are called containers and are used for keeping things inside of. 
						These are very handy for styling when we get to css. 
						You don't need to use them now you just need to know they exists, read more about 
						<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">div's</a>
						You can see where all the boxes are by using the inspector, see short
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwiRPmXhcLY">video</a> from Kahn Academy.
						The inspector will be your workhorse if you are gonna make any website. 
						So you might as well get to meet it.
						But just keep in mind that the html has very little to do with the actual design. 
						In other words: 
					</p>
					<p><em>The html is not the design!</em></p>
					
					<h4>general good ideas:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Use the source code of this page as inspiration 
							for how to write html (right click -> view source)
						</li>
						<li>Do things that gives you a better overview</li>
						<li></li>
					</ul>
					<p>write comments above the code you are talking about not next to or below it.</p>
					
					

					
					<h3>Don'ts</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't replace a heading with a strong tag</li>
					<li>Don't organized your html the way you want it to look on the page</li>
					<li>make unnecessary white space</li>
					<li>headings needs to give a clear overview, for you and the internet</li>
					<li>			
						<p><strong>Don't</strong> just use a tag because you feel like using it, it need's to make sense. </p>
					</li>
					<li>don't cheat, you know what that means</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					Remember just <em>one</em> h1 on each page on a website.
					see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#multiple_h1">mdn</a>. 
					So lets say you have a website with 5 pages each page can have an h1. </p>
				<p>
					Make sure you don't leave space between the tag and the words like so
					<code>
	&lt;p&gt; Don&apos;t leave space before/after a p-tag like here in this paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
					</code>
					
					This also count for h1,h2, em, spans, a, anywhere where there is text. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Don't use strong instead of a h2 or h3, a lot of websites do this, but that dosent make it right.
				Remember we use h1,h2,3 for search optimization, and structure.
