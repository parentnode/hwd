			<h2>Do's and don'ts</h2>
			<h3>Do's</h3>
			<p>
				It is very important that this site is organized in such a way,
				 that it get as good search results as possible on google.
				Organize the html as if it was an article, 
				This will help the search engine getting your page higher in the search results,
				One would imagine.
				the search engine algorithm is probably organized 
				in such a way that html sites that are organized in a better way gets 
				higher priority. nobody really know for sure how the algorithm works.
				it's getting changed all the time.
				it's also important for you to have your html structured in a logical away.
				So when you are later looking for something in your html you will find it.

				
				
				Try to think as if you were a machine trying to understand the content of the  website. The machine will give h1 first property then h2 to then h3 etc.
				the text inside h1 is supposed to give a representation the whole article.
				it's important that google knows what the article is about by only reading h1.
				imagine if you were a search engine you would first go through analyze all h1 once on the internet.

			</p>
			<h3>Don'ts</h3>
			<p>remeber just one h1</p>
