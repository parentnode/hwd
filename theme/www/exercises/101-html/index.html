			<h1>Exercise 101 - HTML text</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is dealing with very basic semantic HTML content formatting, using only 
				heading (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt;), paragraph (&lt;p&gt;), a (&lt;a&gt;), strong (&lt;strong&gt;) and emphasize (&lt;em&gt;) tags.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are two purposes of this exercise: To write HTML <strong>and</strong> to practice deducting
				the semantic structure of an unformatted text.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Get the materials ready</h3>
					<p>
						The materials for this exercise if found in the folder <em>exercises/101-html/101</em>. Copy the 101 folder to your 
						personal homework folder in <em>homework</em>. You created your personal homework folder before you started the
						exercises.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add HTML to the text in 101/index.html</h3>
					<p>
						The structure and hierarchy of the text needs to be reflected by html. You will need to read the
						text to identify the hierarchy of the text.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add a tags for the links</h3>
					<p>
						Links in the text are marked in [xxx]. The links should be applied to the paragraph just before 
						the brackets, using the value inside the brackets as the href property.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add strong and emphasis tags</h3>
					<p>
						Certain words in the sentences could use some additional markup because the are particularly 
						important or needs emphasis.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Check your HTML formatting</h3>
					<p>
						Make sure you opened and closed all tags appropriately.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Validate your HTML on w3c</h3>
					<p>
						Use <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a> to validate your HTML.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Check the document outline</h3>
					<p>
						Use <a href="https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/" target="_blank">https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/</a> to a get a structural representation of your HTML.
					</p>
				</li>

			<h2>Do's and don'ts</h2>

			<h3>Do's</h3>

			<h4>Organize your our html, for you, people and the search engines</h4>
			<p>
				It is important that your html is organized in such a way,
				that it improves your search rank on google.
				The "higher up" your page gets on google the better is the chance that people find it. 
				At the same time its important for people to get an overview when they look at your page, 
				and last but no least you also need to keep an overview of your articles headings paragraphs and subheadings. 
				Read more about html structure why its important and how to do it here on
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals"> structure</a>.
			</p>

			<h4>Example good structure and good indentation:</h4>

			<code>

&lt;div class=&quot;article animals&quot;&gt;

	&lt;h1&gt;Animals living on earth&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;intro text&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;Habitats&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;intro text block&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;Cold climate&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;Warm climate&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;intro text&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;tropical&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;subtropical&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;Types of animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
			</code>


			<p>
				Note also that there is only one heading h1 in the example above. That is a 
				general rule, you only have one h1 per article.  
				So if you for example have 5 pages and you have one article on each page, 
				you should have 5 h1's in total on the entire website.
			</p>
			

			<h4>A bit about indentation</h4>
			<p>
				Note that 1 indentation is normally the size of 4 "spaces" 
				or 2 "spaces", but we use the size of 4 "spaces" in this course,
				if you press the tab button (the one next to the letter Q) 
				you can make an indentation.
				there are several clever ways to deal with indentations, to speed up our workflow. 
				for instance, you can select a code section and indent it all at once.
				you can also remove an indentation with the shortcut  shit + tab.
			</p>
			<h4>Best practice</h4>
			<p>	
				Make sure you don't make 4 spaces instead of an indentation. 
				This might seem silly at first because you could think what difference does it make? 
				When it comes down to it there are several style of code and 
				often coding teams have there own style. 
				Messing with the style can cause a lot of tiresome arguments. 
				Imagine you are a part of a coding team now and here we use a certain style. 
				There is a reason for the style we use. 
				Since the most logical thing to do is to use a tab we use a tab not 4 spaces.
				this might seem a bit OCD'ish. But its important that we are on the same page.  
				There is a lot of situations when you start coding together 
				with other people you will need to agree on coding styles.
				Often the easiest way is to use what is called best practices.
				Here are some good examples of html
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Code_guidelines/HTML">best practices</a>.
				Some times when you are in doubt about what the best practice is ina given situation, ask your team if they have one already? 
				There are most likely some very good arguments, and experience behind the best practices. 
				So just go with it for now. First learn the rules then make new ones when you master the old ones:)  
			</p>

			<h5>best practice: Paragraphs: </h5>
			<code>
&lt;p&gt;
	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
	incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud
	exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
	Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore
	eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt 
	in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
&lt;/p&gt;
<a href=""></a>
			</code>
			<p>
				Note in the code block above how the test text is indented once in relation to the start and end p tag.
				Also note that the width of the code block the text aren't that long. 
				Around 80-100 characters seems to be a good length. 
				A good rule of thump is that you should be able to see the code on you screen when you code. 
				keeping it "short" will make it easier for the eyes to find the next line as well. 
				Keep in mind that a tags(&lt;a&gt;) are always on one line. No mater for long the link is.
			</p>
			


			<h4>Children and parent Elements</h4>
			<p>
				Note that the div start and end tag are above each other.
				This is a way to show us, the coder,
				that the all the "stuff" in between the 2 tags is in fact a "child" of the parent div.
				When an element has 1 or several 
				element "inside" of it the "inner element" is the "child" and the "outer" is a "parent" to that child. 
				So our div here has a lot of children or childnodes as they are also called. 
				So remember indenting elements doesn't make them children of things.
				it's when a tags is inside an other the inner become as child. 
				Just like the a, or em tag is often a child of a p tag.
				So in the example above, we have a lot of headings a p tags that all are sibling to each other  
				since none of them have any children in this example, and the have the same parent div. 
				And in a real html document the div would then have an other parent that we can't see here in our example. 
				And at some point the last parent would be the html tag. 
				Take a look at the exercise or the source code of this page, to see the a parent structure. 
			</p>

			<h4>Tips for good headings</h4>
			<p>
				Headings are a very important for search engines, 
				and people, especially h1. Make sure the headings reveal as much information as possible, 
				the headings are not a teaser, confusing or abstract. 
				The headings should be precise and descriptive and not to short not to long either.
				the worst kind of headings are misleading, 
				and not describing at all what is really going on in the article, aka  "Click bait".
				Bad news papers headings are a good example of bad headings. 
				Good headings are so good that you get a feeling 
				you already know exactly what the rest of the article is about.
				The search algorithm will most likely reward you for this kind of honest behavior.
				So think twice about what you write in a heading.  
			</p>

			<h4>Pay attention to "white spaces"</h4>
			<p>
				White space can be a newline's between paragraph or headings ect.
				it can actually even be the space between 2 words or between a tag and and an other tag. 
				Make sure that the "white space" makes sense to have and there is a consistent system behind it.
				Often It can make sense to leave on line of white space above a heading to make it more readable.
				Remember to delete all the white space that doesn't have a purpose. 
				At least when you hand in code for review.
			</p>
			<p>
				If code blocks are closely related you can arrange them close to each other 
				"without whitespace" in between. See the code example about "animals living on earth." 
				Note how the "text block" under the headings doesn't have a white gap between them.
			</p>


			<h4>Start to think about arranging html elements for styling</h4> 
			<p>
				This is a more complex task that we will get more into in later exercises. 
				For now you need to know that all elements (divs, headings, paragraph ect) 
				can be moved around pretty much as you please later with css. 
				Every start and end tag and also image tags makes up what is called an element. 
				These are all blocks that takes up space in a form of a square on the screen.
				Some elements like divs are called containers and are used for keeping things inside of. 
				These are very handy for styling when we get to css. 
				You don't need to use them now you just need to know they exists, read more about 
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">div's</a>.
				You can see where all the "boxes" are by using the inspector, see short
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwiRPmXhcLY">video</a> from Kahn Academy.
				The inspector will be your workhorse if you are gonna make any website. 
				So you might as well get to meet it.
				But just keep in mind that the html has very little to do with the actual design. 
				In other words: 
			</p>
			<p><em>The html is not the design!</em></p>
			
			<h4>Other good ideas</h4>
			<p>
				Use the source code of this page as inspiration 
				for how to write html (right click -> view page source)
				you might even find mistakes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Make sure you can understand the code if you come back to it in a year. 
				Comments, readme  or personal notes can be good for this.
			</p>
			<p>If you do write comments, write it above the code you are referring to not next to or below it.</p>			
			<p>
				Try to write as few and short comments as possible if you really need them at all. 
				When you change the code, you have to change the comments as well, otherwise you will get lost.
				So fewer comments means less maintenance. But again if nobody else gets it, it need comments.
				Keep the bus-factor low. 
				always ask yourself: If I was hit by a bus tomorrow would anyone else be able to read my code and maintain it?
			</p>
			


		
				
			<h3>Don'ts</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't replace a heading with a strong tag</li>
				<li>Don't organized your html the way you want it to look on the page, wait untill you learn css</li>
				<li>Don't make unnecessary white space</li>
				<li>Don't make bad headings, they needs to give a clear overview, for you and the internet</li>
				<li>Don't just use em or strong tag because you feel like using it, it needs to make sense</li>
				<li>Don't cheat, you know what that means, copy paste ect, you are here to learn</li>
			</ul>
			
				<p>Make sure you don't leave space between the tag and the words like so:</p>
				<code>
&lt;p&gt; Don&apos;t leave space before/after a p-tag like here in this paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
				</code>
				
				This also count for h1,h2, em, spans, a, anywhere where there is text. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One could argue that arranging the example with "the animals on earth" in such a a way that each subheading 
				is indented reletively to the one before like this:
			</p>
				<code>
Dont do this:
	&lt;h2&gt;heading&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;sub heading&lt;/h3&gt;
				</code>
			<p>
				But don't do it. It will get confusing when you have a lot of html.
				Indenting pushes everything to the right, avoid that if possible.
