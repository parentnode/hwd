			<h1>Exercise 101 - HTML text</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is dealing with very basic semantic HTML content formatting, using only 
				heading (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt;), paragraph (&lt;p&gt;), a (&lt;a&gt;), strong (&lt;strong&gt;) and emphasize (&lt;em&gt;) tags.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are two purposes of this exercise: To write HTML <strong>and</strong> to practice deducting
				the semantic structure of an unformatted text.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Get the materials ready</h3>
					<p>
						The materials for this exercise if found in the folder <em>exercises/101-html/101</em>. Copy the 101 folder to your 
						personal homework folder in <em>homework</em>. You created your personal homework folder before you started the
						exercises.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add HTML to the text in 101/index.html</h3>
					<p>
						The structure and hierarchy of the text needs to be reflected by html. You will need to read the
						text to identify the hierarchy of the text.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add a tags for the links</h3>
					<p>
						Links in the text are marked in [xxx]. The links should be applied to the paragraph just before 
						the brackets, using the value inside the brackets as the href property.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Add strong and emphasis tags</h3>
					<p>
						Certain words in the sentences could use some additional markup because the are particularly 
						important or needs emphasis.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Check your HTML formatting</h3>
					<p>
						Make sure you opened and closed all tags appropriately.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Validate your HTML on w3c</h3>
					<p>
						Use <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a> to validate your HTML.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Check the document outline</h3>
					<p>
						Use <a href="https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/" target="_blank">https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/</a> to a get a structural representation of your HTML.
					</p>
				</li>

			<h2>Do's and don'ts</h2>

			<h3>Do's</h3>

			<h4>Organize your our html, for you, people and the search engines</h4>
			<p>
				It is important that your html is organized in such a way,
				that it improves your search rank on google.
				The "higher up" your page gets on google the better is the chance that people find it. 
				At the same time its important for people to get an overview when they look at your page, 
				and last but no least you also need to keep an overview of your articles headings paragraphs and subheadings. 
				Read more about html structure why its important and how to do it here on
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals"> structure</a>.
			</p>

			<h4>Example good structure and good indentation:</h4>

			<code>

&lt;div class=&quot;article animals&quot;&gt;

	&lt;h1&gt;Animals living on earth&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;intro text&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;Habitats&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;intro text block&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;Cold climate&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h3&gt;Warm climate&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;intro text&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;tropical&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;subtropical&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;info text block&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2&gt;Types of animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
			</code>
			<p>
				Note that 1 indentation is normally the size of 4 "spaces" 
				or 2 "spaces", but we use the size of 4 "spaces",
				if you press the tab button (the one next to the letter Q) 
				you can make an indentation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note also that there is only one heading h1 in the example above. That is a 
				general rule, you only have one h1 per article.  
				So if you for example have 5 pages and you have one article on each page, 
				you should have 5 h1's in total on the entire website.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the div start and end tag are above each other.
				This is a way to show us, the coder,
				that the all the "stuff" in between is in fact "inside of it".
				
				When an element has an inner 
				element "inside of it the "inner element" is the child and the "outer" is a parent to that child. 
				So our div here has a lot of children or childnodes as they are also called. 
				So remember indenting elements doesn't make them children of things.
				it's when the tags are inside each other they become children. 
				Just like the a, or em tag is often a child of a p tag.
				So all all the tags inside of our div example are actually siblings to each other, since
				non of them have any children in this example. 
				They all have the same parent div,
				and the div have an other parent we can't see here in our example. 
				At some point there is a 
				parent called a body and later a final parent i the html tag,
				that wraps around everything in out html document, as you see in the exercise.
			</p>
			

			<h5>Tips for good headings</h5>
			<p>
				Headings are a very important for search engines, 
				and people, especially h1. Make sure the headings reveal as much information as possible, 
				the headings are not a teaser, confusing or abstract. 
				The headings should be precise and descriptive and not to short.
				the worst kind of headings are misleading, 
				and not describing at all what is really going on in the article.  "Click bait".
				or bad news papers headings are a good example of bad headings. 
				Good headings are so good that you get a feeling 
				you already know exactly what the rest of the article or sub article is about.
				The search algorithm will most likely reward you for this kind of honest behavior.
				So think twice about what you write in a heading.  
			</p>

			<h4>Pay attention to "white space"</h4>
			<p>
				White space is newline's between paragraph or headings ect.
				it can actually even be the 
				Make sure that the "white space" makes sense and there is a consistent system behind it.
				Often It can make sense to leave on line of white space above a heading to make it more readable.
				Remember to delete all the white space that dosen't have a purpose.
			</p>

			<h4>Starting to think about arranging html elements for styling </h4> 
			<p>
				This is a more complex task that we will get more into in later exercises. 
				For now you need to know that all elements (divs, headings, paragraph ect) 
				can be moved around pretty much as you please later with css. 
				Every start and end tag and also image tags makes up what is called an element. 
				These are all blocks that takes up space in a form of a square on the screen.
				Some elements like divs are called containers and are used for keeping things inside of. 
				These are very handy for styling when we get to css. 
				You don't need to use them now you just need to know they exists, read more about 
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">div's</a>
				You can see where all the boxes are by using the inspector, see short
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwiRPmXhcLY">video</a> from Kahn Academy.
				The inspector will be your workhorse if you are gonna make any website. 
				So you might as well get to meet it.
				But just keep in mind that the html has very little to do with the actual design. 
				In other words: 
			</p>
			<p><em>The html is not the design!</em></p>
			
			<h4>Other good ideas</h4>
			<p>
				Use the source code of this page as inspiration 
				for how to write html (right click -> view page source)
				you might even find mistakes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Make sure you can understand the code if you come back to it in a year. 
				Comments, readme  or personal notes can be good for this.
			</p>

			<p>If you do write comments, write it above the code you are talking about not next to or below it.</p>			
			<p>
				Try to write as few and short comments as possible if you really need them at all. 
				When you change the code you have to change the comments as well, otherwise you will get lost.
				So fewer comments means less maintenance. But again if nobody else gets it, it need comments.
				Keep the bus-factor low. 
				always ask yourself: If I was hit by a bus tomorrow would anyone be able to read my code and maintain it?
			</p>
			
			<p>If things are related you can "glue" them together by not making white space</p>

				
			<h3>Don'ts</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't replace a heading with a strong tag</li>
				<li>Don't organized your html the way you want it to look on the page, wait untill you learn css</li>
				<li>Don't make unnecessary white space</li>
				<li>Don't make bad headings, they needs to give a clear overview, for you and the internet</li>
				<li>			
					<p><strong>Don't</strong> just use a tag because you feel like using it, it need's to make sense. </p>
				</li>
				<li>don't cheat, you know what that means, copy paste ect</li>
			</ul>
			
				<p>Make sure you don't leave space between the tag and the words like so:</p>
				<code>
&lt;p&gt; Don&apos;t leave space before/after a p-tag like here in this paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
				</code>
				
				This also count for h1,h2, em, spans, a, anywhere where there is text. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Don't use strong instead of a h2 or h3, a lot of websites do this, but that dosent make it right.
				Remember we use h1,h2,3 for search optimization, and structure.
			</p>

			<p>
				One could argue that arranging the example with the div in such a a way the each subheading 
				is indented reletively to the one before like this:
				<code>
Dont do this:
	&lt;h2&gt;heading&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;sub heading&lt;/h3&gt;
				</code>
				But dont do it. It will get confusing when you have a lot of html. 
			</p>
