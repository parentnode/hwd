Basic semantic HTML

In this article, you will get to work with h1, h2, h3, p, strong and em tags.

The basic semantic text tags

The minimum set of semantic text HTML tags contains h1, h2, h3, p, strong and em. Although there are many other 
semantic html tags, these are the most important ones to learn.

Other semantic HTML tags include table, ul, ol and dl.

We will look more at the other semantic tags later.

The h1 tag

The h1 tag is the primary headline of a page. There should only ever be one primary headline in a page. Read more about heading tags [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements].

The h2 tag

The h2 tag is for secondary headlines in your page. The secondary headlines are used for each subsection 
of the primary content.

There will often be multiple secondary headlines in your pages.

The h3 tag

The h3 tag is for tertiary headlines in your page. The tertiary headlines are used for each subsection 
of the current secondary section.

There will often be multiple tertiary headlines in your pages.

The p tag

The p tag is used for a paragraph of text. Each headline will typically be followed by one or more 
paragraphs, relating directly to the previous headline.

There will often be multiple paragraphs in your pages. Read more about the p tag [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p].

The strong tag

The strong tag is used to indicate that a certain word (or several words) are more important in the context.

The strong tag is an inline tag and should only be used inside headlines, paragraphs and list elements. Read more about the strong tag [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong].

The em tag

The em tag is used to indicate that a certain word (or several words) needs emphasis in the context.

The em tag is an inline tag and can only be used inside headlines or paragraphs. Read more about the em tag [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em].

Summary

Now you have a basic understanding of HTML text semantics. You have added a hierarchy to the text and made it easier
to read and to be understood by a machine. Let's move on the some of the other semantic tags. Read more about HTML tags [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML].
