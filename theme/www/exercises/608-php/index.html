			<h1>Exercise 608 - Janitor CSS/JavaScript production bundles</h1>
			<p>
				This exercise is about developing your first Janitor based PHP project
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of this exercise is to work with your personal Janitor project to gain experience
				with Janitor.
			</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Understand the merging / bundling process</h3>
					<p>
						Your JavaScript and CSS has been structured for an optimized workflow with the intention to merge
						the individual JavaScript and CSS files into just two files. One for JavaScript and one for CSS. 
						Per segment. One reason for this is to minimize the requests made by your site.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <em>js/lib/seg_#segment#_include.js</em> and <em>css/lib/seg_#segment#_include.css</em> files
						contain all the information to build each segment bundle, by merging all the files listed in each 
						include into one file. 
						After building your production bundles, you will see the result in <em>js/seg_#segment#.js</em> and 
						<em>css/seg_#segment#.css</em>. One JavaScript file and one CSS file for each segment you support.
					</p>
					<p>
						The actual building process is handled by scripts in two separate submodules, 
						<em>js-merger</em> and <em>css-merger</em>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Build bundles</h3>
					<p>
						To build the production bundles, you have to request the building script through your browser.
						Simply visit <em>#your-domain#.local/js/lib/build</em> to build the JavaScript bundles and
						<em>#your-domain#.local/css/lib/build</em> to build the CSS bundles.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you visit these pages, they will output information about the building process. You can click
						on each file in the view to see more details.
					</p>
					<p>
						If there are any errors in the output, then fix the errors and build again. The building process is not
						complete until the scripts have been run without errors.
					</p>
					<p>
						When the process is done, check the result in your Git application and commit the updated files.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Janitor backend JavaScript and CSS</h3>
					<p>
						The backend interface of Janitor is also using Detector and Manipulator, which also needs to be built
						after install and each time you upgrade Janitor. You also need to build again if you add custom 
						code to either <em>theme/www/janitor/js</em> or <em>theme/www/janitor/css</em>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To build the Janitor backend bundles visit <em>#your-domain#.local/janitor/js/lib/build</em> and 
						<em>#your-domain#.local/janitor/css/lib/build</em>.
					</p>
