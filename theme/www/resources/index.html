			<h2>Resources</h2>

			<p>
				The aim of this page is to have all the study material needed to complete the course. 
				It is our hope that you one day can add the knowledge you think is needed to this page. 	
			</p>

			<h3>How do you use the resourses?</h3>

			<p>
				The main idea is that you go though each exercise and read the resource for that exercise. Its organized so you can read it from A to Z.
				You can also search (use CTRL + F) and type in what you are looking for, or you can look through the chapters and see if something looks usefull.			
			</p>

			<h3>General "nice to know" information before you start</h3>

			<p>
				There are so many interesting modern tools you are about to learn and they all free and availible online. You dont look amazed. Well its kind of crazy how well things are working today. 
				okay but lets see where do we start. Really I wanna start by giving you a little bit of history.. ok I see you are falling asleep lets get on with it :) 
				But I gotta tell you some boring stuff I'm afraid, And if you can't deal with some boring stuff once in a while well.. Sorry but thats life..
				I will try to make it fun :)

					There is some roumers that coding can be very difficult and extremely tough and you have to spend days finding and error sometimes..
				</p>
