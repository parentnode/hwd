			<h2>Resources</h2>

			<p>
				The aim of this page is to have all the study material needed to complete the course. 
				It is our hope that you one day can add the knowledge you think is needed to this page. 	
			</p>

			<h3>How do you use the resources?</h3>

			<p>
				The main idea is that you go though each exercise and read the resource for that exercise. Its organized so you can read it from A to Z.
				You can also search (use CTRL + F) and type in what you are looking for, or you can look through the chapters and see if something looks useful.			
			</p>

			<h3>General "nice to know" information before you start.</h3>

			<p>
				There are so many interesting modern tools you are about to learn and they all free and available online. You don't look amazed. Well its kind of crazy how well things are working today. 
				okay but lets see where do we start. Really I wanna start by giving you a little bit of history.. ok I see you are falling asleep lets get on with it :) 
				But I gotta tell you some boring stuff I'm afraid, And if you can't deal with some boring stuff once in a while well.. Sorry but thats life..
				I will try to make it fun :) 
				
			</p>

			<h3>Nice to know about coding </h3>
			<p> 
				Coding is a slang for programming, if you wanna be a programmer you gonna have to start sounding like one ;)  
				I know you are properly eager to getting started with some coding, but first I gotta tell you a few things. While you can still go back.. (imagine gasping sound effect) 
				There is some rumors that coding can be very difficult and extremely tough and you have to spend days finding an error sometimes..
			</p>

			<p>All true I'm afraid</p>

			<p>Well don't run yet.. Lets look at some of the brighter sides of coding, and some of my personal reasons I learned to program</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Coding dose make you smarter, because science says so (google it)</li>
				<li>Knowing to code is like having a secret superpower. Unless you tell everyone you meet like I do (note to self: stop telling girls you are a super hero they leave when they hear you are a programmer..)</li>
				<li>You don't need to know complicated math to code, (puh, add sound of relief), but if you know some math you might finally use those skills if you feel like it.</li>
				<li>Some non-coders think you are super intelligent ;)</li>
				<li>Some people like programmers</li>
				<li>You are getting one step to closer to finally making that smart app idea, && || you will start getting ideas (&& = and || = or in code in most languages)</li>
				<li>You can program anywhere in the world</li>
				<li>Coding is a bit like Lego's there is a lot of different blocks, and you can find them all online for free</li>
				<li>There is giant community online where you can get and find help, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. </li>
				<li>Programming doesn't need to be hard</li>
				<li>Coding teaches you patients</li>
				<li>Did I mention you can make money from it? </li>
				<li>
					If you are smart you program something that generates money. 
					Then you can spend more time on other things than working, like coding for fun, or getting a strange hobby ;)
				</li>
				
			</ul>
			<p>Im sure you can find a lot of more reasons to learn programming, check out the great ted talks about programming on youtube here's is one:</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfBWk4nw440">You Should Learn to Program: Christian Genco at TEDxSMU</a></p>
	
			
			<p>So where where we. No I hope you feel more motivated, there are properly a lot I haven't thought of but hey.</p>
			<p>ok so now ask you self if you got what it takes to really become a programmer?</p>
			<p>did you think about it?</p>

			<p>ok lets see on my list there are a few skills you might need, I'm not thinking math or logics even for that matter. 
				I'm thinking of deeper skills like being able to do something even when it gets hard, and having the ability to put it away and do the dishes, and come back and let your brain work for you. </p>
				<p> good skills / abilities to have before you start learning programming</p>
				<ul>
					<li>stubbornness :) yes sometimes if you keep at it the wall will break, but take care your head might crack as well</li>
					<li>An inner need for fixing stuff</li>
					<li>An ability to break a problem into bits</li>
					<li>Enjoying fixing things, like a bike, fixing things is a lot like programming</li>
					<li>Being good at following a recipe or manual</li>
					<li>social skills, why you might think, well you become a lot better when you learn from someone, and when you start teaching</li>
					<li>A need for order helps as well</li>
					<li>Knowing how the basics of how to use a computer, install programs ect</li>
					<li>And most importantly motivation, this is a must have</li>
				</ul>

			<p>So what if you don't really have the motivation?</p>
			<p>
				You wanna know what I did? I first met programming at uni, I wasn't interest.
				I thought it took to long, It didn't help that one teacher was slow and an other was an arrogant person. 
				So for a while I really doubted if I should learn it at all. 
				And I changed university, and I started on biology instead of programming. 
				But biochemistry was extremely hard to follow while I also was learning physics and math. 
				I had an interest in physics because Im fascinated with weird inventions especially perpetual motion machines. So I thought programming could become useful, 
				I also had a dream about making a social organizing tool for a thing called sociocracy, that I knew was needed.
				I was active in an urban garden and started thinking about how to make a snail killing robot I figured that programming would come in handy.
				And during my years at uni I learned about arduino a super beginner friendly way of making small robots.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				So I actually had plenty of reasons to get involved in programming, I guess I just had to find out how I could use it. 
				But to keep motivated I made a list and I put it on the back of the toilet door in the collective where i lived, so when people was sitting whey could read it. 
				Soon everyone wanted to learn programming :) 
			</p>
			<p>so the question is what will keep you motivated?</p>
			<p>please stop reading and make a list and but it up somewhere where you will see it :) </p>

			<h3>Motivation in place</h3>

			<p>So you are you back from the toilet?</p>
			<p>Now you better keep that motivation, give this a real shot try your best:) i'm rooting on you</p>

			<p>
				So with the very important foundation the motivation in order we can start looking at some coding very soon.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before I write a whole novel about how to use html, css, javscript (js) and PHP, 
				I gotta say that there is a lot of good place where you can learn that already.
				but why do you need this course then? well the truth is you don't <em>need</em> it to become a programmer.
				You can go of now into the internet wilderness and learn programming if you keep at it you will get there.
				but why not follow a guide who has been through the maintains before? the guide knows how to cross streams and how go through the jungle find the hidden trails. 
				Believe me there is plenty of hidden trails, weird little hacks that you would maybe never find. 
			</p>
			<p>actually all this hacks has been put togther into a libary of hacks also called a documentation(or docs).</p>
			<p>parent node has its own, see <a href="http://manipulator.local/docs">documentation</a> </p>	
			
			<p>
				why? because we at parent node thought that all these hacks where worth sharing and make accessible to the whole world. 
				and Its also what we use so we can write faster and better code. we will get more into that. but take a look at it if you feel like it. 
			</p>

			<p>
				So you are actually gonna learn a lot more than just plain js (and PHP?) you will learn a lot of tricks ;) 
				and you wont learn them other places. thank us later :) 
				We also have an other way of doing things like say wordpress, we don't use weird modules that don't fit together, 
				we code everything, we can take it apart and really fix it. its not "pseudo programming". 
				You don't just learn how to use a hammer you also learn to use the fine special tools. 
			</p>

			<p>So to get more time with us and get feed back on you exercises, we prefere that you read how to write html,css and js from the prefered documentaion on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"> mozilla mdn</a> </p>
			
			<p>Here for html docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">html</a></p>
			<p>Here for css docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Css">css</a></p>
			<p>Here for  js docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">js</a></p>
			<p>
				Here is the php <a href="https://www.php.net/docs.php">documentation</a>
				There page might be a bit dry. but you can check out the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php">php tutorial</a>
				on they docs page. here is a lot of stuff you need to know.
			</p>
			<p>
				Take care with reading how to do things on other sites since they don't always teach the right things. 
				They sometimes use some strange hack that is ruining the rest of the code. 
				Stick to mozilla mdn its maintained by the team behind firefox.
			</p>
			<p>
				If videos are more your thing try to go on Kahn Academy its free, and really well made, they go through all the topics, from html css and js. 
				After each video there is exercises, its a good supplement to the reading. 
				For php there is a good free course online on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php">Codecademy</a>.
			</p>
		
			<h3>You need a code editor</h3>
			<p>
				Maybe you have done some coding exercises on kahn academy and 
				Now you wanna get started on the real exercises.
			</p>
			<p>To get started on our exercises we first need to get an application on the pc up and running</p>
			<p>
				What you are gonna install is called a code editor, its like a text editor that helps ou spellchecking. 
				But instead of spell checking you can get al sort of smart plug-ins, like auto completing code so you dont need to write every single sign. 

			</p>
			<p>The editor I use is called <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual studio code</a>(vsc for short)</p>
			<p>If you are using mac or linux you can also use it</p>
			
			<p>When you have the editor installed you are ready to get the project down on your computer and into your visual studio code</p>

			
			<h3>How to get the exercises from github</h3>
			
			<p>So first of all you should make an account on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a></p>
			<p>
				Github is basically a place where you can get access to all the projects that are open to the public, it could be any open source project in the world.
				but more than just storing a lot of code the essential thing is that its a git system, and git is a way of getting access to older versions of some code localy on your pc. 
				The smart thing about git is if you made a mistake you can go back through all the older versions while it was still working. 
				And on github you can also see what changes there where made by who and lots of other things, you can merge projects fork them ect you can read more about that if you are curious.
				Well the bottom line is you are gonna upload your projects on to <a href="https://github.com/parentnode">github/parentnode</a> every time you have something worth up loading to save it on a cloud. 
				So if you loose or break your pc you you still have the code and we can see what you are doing. I hope you don't store important things on your pc in general. 
				If you do please get it on a cloud for your own sake. :) 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				So now you hopefully know what github is about and you made a user and password. 
				Then you are gonna have to follow the steps here I present to you carefully. (make a video?)
				Well the steps are:		
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Make a folder called "Sites" in your home directory. like C:/Sites </li>
				
			</ol>
